# Tier 1 Event Configurator

DA-hosted authoring app for Tier 1 (MAX/Summit-scale) event config: primary Digital
Agenda track icons/colors, allow-double-booking, and featured sessions — one
config per Event ID, authored once and pasted by hand into that event's page
metadata (`tier-1-event-config`).

See [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) for the full design, decisions, and phase breakdown
([MWPW-201380](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/MWPW-201380)).

## Status

Phases 1a–1d are implemented: DA SDK auth, config-library sheet CRUD, the
library list view (search/Edit/Duplicate/Delete/Copy config), and the ESP
event picker + session fetch. Phase 1e (track icon/color editor), Phase 2
(allow-double-booking), and Phase 3 (featured sessions) are still open —
their sections in the editor currently show a "coming soon" placeholder.

**Known interim gap:** the track list shown in the editor comes from a raw
`getEventSessionCatalog()` call in `event-libs/v1/utils/esp-controller.js`,
not from `sessions-api.js`'s `fetchSessions()` — that function is still
mock-only on `dev` as of this writing (its real ESP-backed rewrite lives on
the in-progress MWPW-200314 branch). Once that rewrite merges to `dev`,
`getEventSessionCatalog()`/`extractDistinctTracks()` here should be replaced
by importing the shared `fetchSessions(eventId)` instead of hitting ESP
directly a second time.

## Architecture

Same shape as the [Schedule Maker](../schedule-maker/README.md) precedent:
Preact + HTM + Spectrum Web Components, no build step, DA SDK auth via
`context/DAContext.js` (ported unchanged).

- `tier-1-event-configurator.js` — entry point; loads Spectrum components, mounts the app.
- `TierOneEventConfigurator.js` — root shell (loading/error/toast states, page routing).
- `context/DAContext.js` — DA SDK auth (org/repo/token).
- `context/NavigationContext.js` — library ↔ editor page state.
- `context/ConfigsContext.js` — config-library list state, CRUD actions, toasts.
- `scripts/da-controller.js` — `readSheet`/`writeSheet`/`mutateSheet` (ETag optimistic
  locking, ported from Schedule Maker's pre-link-first-pivot implementation) plus
  `getConfigs`/`upsertConfig`/`deleteConfig` on top.
- `pages/Library.js` — searchable list of every authored config; New/Edit/Duplicate/
  Delete/Copy config actions.
- `pages/ConfigEditor.js` — per-event editor; fetches that event's session catalog on
  open, shows the resulting `Config` JSON and a copy-to-clipboard action.
- `components/EventPicker.js` — ESP event picker (search + published/draft filter),
  used by both New config and Duplicate.
- `components/Modal.js`, `components/SearchInput.js` — generic, ported from Schedule Maker.

## Data model

One shared DA sheet per content-repo at
`/tools/da-apps/tier-1-event-configurator/configs.json`, one row per Event ID:

```json
{
  "eventId": "...",
  "eventTitle": "...",
  "config": {
    "eventId": "...",
    "eventTitle": "...",
    "updated": "2026-07-22T21:30:00.000Z",
    "trackIcons": { "Track Name": { "icon": "icon-slug", "color": "#RRGGBB" } },
    "allowDoubleBooking": true,
    "featuredSessions": ["sessionId1", "sessionId2"]
  },
  "updated": "2026-07-22T21:30:00.000Z"
}
```

`config` is the exact value an author copies into their event page's own
`tier-1-event-config` metadata row — this app never touches the page itself.

## Loader

`tools/da-apps/tier-1-event-configurator.html` in `da-events` (separate PR)
mounts this app via ES module import, branch-driven by the DA SDK's
`context.ref` — same pattern as Schedule Maker's loader.

## Local development

Point the loader's `context.ref` at your branch (push the same branch name
to both `da-events` and `event-libs`), or serve this directory directly and
open it in a browser with `#app` present — DA SDK auth will fail outside a
real da.live iframe, so full end-to-end testing requires the da-events
loader route.
